# Slide

You can play the game [here](https://chertkov.itch.io/slide)

Slide! is a rythm game where you have to press the right button on beat when the note (pink rhombus) aligns with the knob of the slide (yellow circle on the left) while it's in the red zone. The more on beat you are, the more points you receive. The game was made in 72 hours as a Ludum Dare 48 game jam entry.

There's also a second slide appearing at some point, for which you have to use the separate button (J for the left one and K for the right one).

The theme of the jam was "Deeper and deeper" so the idea is that at some point sliders extend and you can go lower which adds variety and challenge to the gameplay.
(I messed up the UI scaling though, so level 3 migh be bugged for some resoultions, making the level impossible to beat perfectly, so I recommend minimizing the view, reloading the page and trying the level a couple of times as this might sometimes help).  

Here's how the bugged level looks like

And here's this level running perfectly fine

I was responsible for most of the technical aspects of the game, i.e. programming.  
Music was made by my teammate [Chertkov](https://chertkov.itch.io/).  

The game was made using Unity 2019
